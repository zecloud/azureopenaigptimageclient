# Azure OpenAI GPT Image Client

An asynchronous Python client for interacting with the Azure OpenAI GPT-Image API. This library simplifies the process of making requests to the Azure OpenAI GPT-Image service, providing an easy-to-use interface for developers.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Design**: Fully asynchronous, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies interaction with Azure OpenAI GPT-Image services.
- **Customizable**: Configure client settings to suit your application needs.


## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the client:

```python
import asyncio
from azureopenaigptimageclient import GPTImageClient

async def main():
    # Initialize the client with your Azure API key and endpoint
    client = GPTImageClient(api_key="your-api-key", endpoint="your-endpoint")

    # Generate an image
    response = await client.generate_image(prompt="A futuristic cityscape at sunset")
    print(response)

     # Edit an image
    await client.edit_image(
        image_path="image_to_edit.png",
        mask_path="mask.png",
        prompt="Make this black and white",
        output_file="edited_image.png"
    )

     # Make your portrait in star wars starry night style
    await client.edit_image(
        image_path="yout_portrait.png",
        prompt="""Transform it into A high-resolution digital portrait inspired by the Star Wars universe. He is sitting in a dimly lit sci-fi environment with soft, ambient lighting. He wears futuristic robes or gear that reflect a Jedi or rebel aesthetic. His surroundings include subtle sci-fi elements like control panels or holograms. Put A metallic high tech moon with an hole  in the sky. The image is photo-realistic and cinematic. Make it a pinting in the starry night style""",
        output_file="starwarsstarrynight.png"
    )
    

# Run the example
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

The client requires the following:

- **API Key**: Your Azure API key for authentication.
- **Endpoint**: The endpoint URL for your Azure OpenAI GPT-Image service.

You can set these values when initializing the client.
